# win_brenda_console (beta)

**WARNING, THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON PROJECT AND IT MAY HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY COST YOU MONEY. PLEASE ONLY USE THIS IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH PYTHON AND BRENDA AND YOU ARE HAPPY WITH MY CODE. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUES I'VE POSTED - THERE ARE MORE!**

Simple console for operating James Yonan's [Brenda](https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda) for Blender on Windows without command lines. I wrote this for myself but thought others might find it useful. It's my first Python program so i'm sure it has issues but seems to work ok for me. I've only put in the commands I use for now but may add more.
